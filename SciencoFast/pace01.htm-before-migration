  EXCLUSIVE BENEFITS OF THE PACE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR
</H2>
<P>
PACE&reg; will handle any combination of fresh water, salt water, free oil,
mechanical emulsions and chemical emulsions. It will consistently and reliably
produce clean water for discharge.
<P>
PACE&reg; will handle petroleum fuel and lubricating oils ranging in viscosity
and specific gravity from N&#176;2 diesel to N&#176;5 heavy fuel oil without
modifications or heaters at ordinary room temperatures. If the oil will flow,
PACE&reg; can process it.
<P>
PACE&reg; will accumulate and automatically eject the oil recovered from
emulsions.
<P>
The ability of the system to discharge clean, oil-free water does not depend
upon the skill of the operator.
<P>
There are no adjustments.
<P>
PACE&reg; is the most practical, the most economical and the most reliable
method of breaking chemical emulsions. This patented system is the best oil/water
separator in the world.
<P>
PACE&reg; converts grey emulsions into clear water and black oil. The water
is suitable for legal discharge, and the oil is concentrated to the point
where it will support combustion. The volume of oil for separate disposal
can be reduced by up to 98%.
<P>
In addition, you can recover the active cleaning agents and water in your
oil-contaminated wash solution for reuse, and do so with a substantial return
of your investment.
<P>
Neither electrical failure nor operator error will cause oil to be discharged.
<P>
The only maintenance normally required is:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    periodic in-place washing of the membrane using detergent and water, and
  <LI>
    normal strainer and bag filter maintenance.
</UL>
<P>
Sophisticated process technology produces simple equipment. The only moving
parts are an ordinary centrifugal pump and four solenoid valves. The few
controls required are conventional.
<P>
Tank, skid, structure and piping are heavily constructed and reinforced to
withstand the most severe operating conditions.
<P>
Internal tank arrangement, flow regulation and a unique interface sensor
prevent discharge of oil containing excessive amount of water.
<P>
The system is completely self-contained, with all valves and controls necessary
for automatic operation, detergent in-place washing, filling and draining

  UNIT SPECIFICATION: PACE&reg; OIL/WATER SEPARATOR
</H2>
<H3>
  Operation
</H3>
<P>
Suction generated by the pump draws fresh wastewater into the primary separator.
Free oil is separated and rises to the top of the primary separator. Chemical
and mechanical emulsions pass through the bag filter into the second stage
of treatment.
<P>
These emulsions are pumped across the surface of the membrane at high velocity
and moderate pressure. Water, salts and detergents are forced through the
membrane. Oil is rejected. The concentrated emulsion then passes through
the reservoir, where excess oil is stripped and returned to the primary
separator.
<P>
The remainder passes back to the pump suction, so that the pumping rate is
much greater than the system output. High velocity flow across the membrane
surface shears excess oil and minimizes fouling.
<P>
Discharge of clean water from the system produces the vacuum required to
draw wastewater into the system.
<P>
The primary separator is full of liquid at all times. As oil is accumulated,
emulsion is displaced and the oil/water interface moves lower. When this
interface reaches the interface sensor, it triggers the oil-ejection cycle.
<P>
The pump stops, the clean water discharge solenoid valve closes and the water
inlet solenoid valve opens. Water under regulated line pressure ejects the
accumulated oil through the oil discharge check valve fitted on the primary
separator.
<P>
Once a preset quantity of oil has been ejected, the pump starts, the water
inlet solenoid valve closes and the clean water discharge solenoid valve
opens.
<H3>

  SERVICE FACTORS
</H2>
<P>
PACE is a variable flow device. The throughput to be expected in service
will depend upon four major factors:
<P>
1. The total dynamic head the system must overcome (TDH Service Factor)
<P>
2. The temperature of the wastewater (Temperature Service Factor)

In order to properly select a specific application, you must first determine
a value for each of these Service Factors using the table provided.
<H3>
  TDH Service Factor
</H3>
<P>
As the total dynamic head (TDH) which the unit must overcome increases, the
differential pressure available to force water through the membrane decreases,
and flow decreases accordingly. The total dynamic head (TDH) includes suction
lift, discharge head and friction losses.

  Temperature Service Factor

The viscosity of water decreases as its temperature increases. The pores
of the Membrane are so tiny that a decrease in the water's viscosity reduces
the membrane's resistance to flow.

  Membrane Service Factor
</H3>
<P>
Standard Membranes are designed to reject oil, and may pass light hydrocarbon
such as aliphatic hydrocarbons. Alternate Membranes which will reject these
lighter fractions have smaller pores than do standard Membranes. They therefore
provide more resistance to flow.

Multiply the demand flow in liters/day times the TDH SERVICE FACTOR times
the PROCESS WATER SERVICE FACTOR times the WATER TEMPERATURE SERVICE FACTOR
times the MEMBRANE SERVICE FACTOR to get the corresponding nominal rating.
Select the next largest unit.
<P>
<B>Example 1</B>: general shop wastewater containing detergents, lubricating
and hydraulic oils, daily flow = 1,000 l, Temperature =20&#176;C, Discharge
Head =3 m. Use the standard membrane and size the unit per the service factors
as follows:
<P ALIGN=Center>
1000 x 1.1 x 2.0 x 1.48 x 1.0 = 3,256 l/day
<P>
Select a PACE S-2 with nominal rated capacity of 6,080 l/day.
<P>
<B>Example 2</B>: caustic washwater from engine rebuilding operation containing
lubricating oil, detergents, emulsifying agents and other light fraction
hydrocarbons. Daily flow = 5,000 l, temperature = 30&#176;C, open discharge.
Use the tight membrane and size the unit per the service factors as follows:
<P ALIGN=Center>
5000 x 1.0 x 2.0 x 1.18 x 1.5 = 17,700 l/day
<P>
Select a PACE S-4 with nominal rated capacity of 24,700 l/day and specify
installation of tight membranes.
<H3>
  Shop testing
</H3>
<P>
We can test a sample of your process water. Please contact us for details.
<H3>
  Pilot installations
</H3>
<P>
If flow is critical, a pilot run using a PACE test unit may be required on
site. These units are available. Please contact us for details.
<H3>
  Larger installations
</H3>
<P>
Standard units can be connected in parallel to handle large flows. Compared
with field-erected systems, factory-built units offer lower total installed
cost, better quality control and reduced lead times.
<H3>
  Special systems
</H3>
<P>
Integrated PACE / Centrifuge systems can efficiently process wastewater
containing oil concentrations too high for normal ultrafiltration. The outputs
are clean water and oil suitable for sale or for use as fuel.
<H3>
  Modular installations
</H3>
<P>
In certain applications, a fully configured PACE unit may not be required,
only the second stage with its ability to break chemical emulsions and produce
clean water. The PACE second stage can be furnished separately in all the
standard sizes and rated capacities (SK-Series).
