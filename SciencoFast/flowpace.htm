<P>
<B>1. INLET</B>: fitted with oversized basket strainer to keep solids out
of the system. Check valve prevent back flow when oil is ejected. Piping
is oversized to handle heavy oil.
<P>
<B>2. PRIMARY SEPARATOR</B>: efficiently removes free oil, and accumulates
both free oil and oil recovered from emulsions for automatic ejection.
<P>
<B>3. INTERFACE SENSOR</B>: automatically controls ejection of accumulated
oil.
<P>
<B>4. DRAIN</B>: drain valve and flanged access hatch are provided for washdown
and desludging, if ever required.
<P>
<B>5. OIL DISCHARGE</B>: check valve prevents backflow when system is drawing
in wastewater. Piping is oversized to handle heavy oil.
<P>
<B>6. PUMP</B>: industrial duty centifugal pump provides pressure to discharge
clean water, and suction to lift wastewater into the system.
<P>
<B>7. MEMBRANE</B>: breaks the emulsion. Passes detergents, salts and water.
Will not pass oil.
<P>
<B>8. BAG FILTER</B>: protects membrane from fine suspended solids.
<P>
<B>9. CLEAN WATER DISCHARGE</B>: visual flowmeter for simple, reliable out
put readings. Solenoid and check valves for automatic operation without backflow.
<P>
<B>10. RESERVOIR</B>: recovers oil stripped from the emulsion and returns
it to the Primary Separator. Provides the water volumes required for periodic
in-place washing of the membrane.
<P>
<B>11. FUNNEL</B>: convenient fill point for detergent during periodic in-place
washing of the membrane.
<P>
<B>12. AIR VENT</B>: automatically bleeds air during draining and filling.
<P>
<B>13. WATER INLET</B>: solenoid valve and pressure regulator automatically
control ejection of accumulated oil.
<P>
<B>14. ENTRAINED AIR SENSOR</B>: liquid level sensor detects vacuum leaks
in piping, associated indicator lamp on the control panel alerts personnel
to prevent wasting water.CONTROL PANEL: complete heavy-duty industrial unit
controls all system operations. Reliable conventional controls. Terminals
provided for remote indicators and alarms.
